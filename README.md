# Bike Rental Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the number of bikes rented based on various factors such as weather, season, and day. The dataset provided consists of two datasets containing information from approximately 11,000 individuals, with a total of 12 variables, including the target variable.

## Task 1: Regression Algorithm Development

In this task, the goal is to develop regression algorithms to predict the number of bikes rented for each time slot. The training dataset contains the target variable, which will be used to build the algorithms. However, the testing dataset does not include the target variable.

### Models to be Developed

You are required to develop at least three models, with two of them being SVM models and one based on a decision tree algorithm. These models will be used to predict the target variable for the testing dataset. 

### Evaluation of Predictions

After building the regression models, you need to compare the consistency of predictions between the three algorithms. This comparison should assess the similarity and agreement of predictions made by the models. The evaluation will be based on a scale of 10 points.

## Task 2: Clustering Analysis

In this task, clustering will be performed on the dataset to create homogeneous groups that separate the data based on similarities. Both datasets will be combined for this analysis.

### Clustering Approach

The goal is to apply clustering algorithms to the dataset and create clusters that effectively separate the data into groups with similar characteristics. The clustering process will consider all variables in the dataset.

### Evaluation based on Target Variable

The clusters created will be evaluated based on their ability to separate the dataset according to the target variable. This evaluation will determine if the clusters effectively group the data points with similar rental patterns together. The evaluation will be based on a scale of 10 points.
